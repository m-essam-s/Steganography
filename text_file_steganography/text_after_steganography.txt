The  Northern                        Lights,  Aurora Borealis,  appear in a clear  night  sky as swirling rivers of  greenish-blue  light.  They move  and  dance unpredictably;  sometimes  barely  perceptible, then suddenly  growing vivid.  In  simple  terms, the auroras  can be explained  as an  interaction  of  the  solar  wind and  the  Earth’s magnetic field.  The solar wind  consists  of charged particles  emanating from the  Sun.  These are captured by  the Earth’s  magnetic  field and drawn towards  the poles  at  a very high speed.
The phenomenon occurs  when  the particles collide               with  atoms and  molecules  in the upper  atmosphere  (the ionosphere), transforming kinetic energy into  visible light.
Aurora Borealis  can appear in  many different shapes.  Early  at night,  it  is  usually a  grand  arc  stretching  across  the  sky from  east to west. Usually  it  is green and with fuzzy  edges.  The  bottom of  the  arc is  quite  sharp  while the upper  edge is  blurred.
Sometimes,  the  arc can be  active and start  moving so  it  looks  like  curtains.  You may  see  rays of light  that appear in  the  same direction as  the Earth’s magnetic  field.  The length of the  arc can  reach  up to 1000 km  or more,  while  its width can be limited to  as  little as 100 m.
An  aurora band  is  similar to an arc but crimped  or  curled into  a  spiral. If you  stand  right underneath the northern lights in  the same direction  as the magnetic  field, the Aurora  rays  appear to  originate  from  one single  point  and  radiate  outwards.  This  is called  a corona.
In fact, there  is  always Northern Lights somewhere on  the  sky  even if  you  can’t see  it.  Around  the Earth’s magnetic  poles there  is  always  a ring of  Aurora but you  may be  in  the  wrong  location.  Or, you  may  be in the  right location but  still  can’t see it  because of clouds,  daylight  or bright summer nights.
